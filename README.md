To whom it may concern,

Hi, I hope I've completed everything you were looking for!

I noticed that when clicking on a navigation tab within the same page, the hash is updated but the page is not refreshed. I've put something in place so if you click on a nav tab on the same html page, the scroller takes you to the appropriate panel and closes the nav modal. The rest of the breadcrumb nav works as before.

I've loaded the x-axis swipes via ajax, but you get cross domain errors if you're using file:// protocol. In this instance it falls back to standard page refreshes.

Cheers
